    | Agile* is a small subsurface consulting team.

    | We can help you build anything. Seriously.

We love the digital subsurface, and we love open science. We get excited about creative collaboration, open access, open data, professional excellence, and we're passionate about helping scientists learn to program. And make open source tools for each other.
